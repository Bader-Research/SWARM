Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, AIX:

1. Download the multicore-swarm tar ball.
2. Type tar -xvzf swarm-x.y.tar.gz. Where 'x.y' is the version number. This will create a subdirectory called swarm-x.y . All of swarm's source code will be untarred here.
3. Type in the following commands to get SWARM running.
        cd swarm-x.y
        ./configure           This will create the makefile
        make                   This will create the library
        make test            This will check the library with test routines
4. An executable swarm_test is created in the swarm-x.y/tests directory. Type ./swarm_test to run the test code. -t option can be used to specify the number of threads to be used.

MS Windows:

1.On installation, following 2 folders will be created in swarm-x.y (x.y is the version number) directory:
       pthreads:
           pthreads/include - requisite pthreads header files
           pthreads/lib - dynamic library for pthreads
       swarm:
           swarm/include - function declarations for SWARM API
           swarm/lib - dynamic library for swarm
           swarm/tests - test codes
2. The System PATH will automatically be set to point to the dll files swarm.dll and pthreadVC2.dll
3. In the tests folder, double click the VC++ project 'SWARM_Test'
4. Click on Build -> Build Solution to compile. You will be asked to save Swarm_Test. Select Save.
5. Click on Debug -> Start without debugging to Execute.
6. Command line arguments can be specified in Project -> Swarm_Test Properties -> Configuration Properties -> Debugging -> Command arguments. (eg -t <number of threads>).
